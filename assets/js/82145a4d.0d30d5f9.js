These containers include your application, all necessary dependencies, and even a minimal operating system \u2014 so they run **consistently on any computer**.\n\n> \ud83d\udc49 Think of Docker as a \u201cportable lab environment\u201d that always works the same way, no matter where it runs.\n\n---\n\n### Why is Docker useful for ROS?\n\nInstalling ROS (Robot Operating System) manually can be **complex and error-prone**, especially when dealing with different operating systems, conflicting library versions, or specific dependencies.\n\nDocker solves this by:\n\n- Providing **identical environments** for all participants  \n- Reducing setup time to just a few minutes  \n- Preventing accidental damage to your own OS  \n- Allowing multiple ROS versions side by side  \n- Making your entire setup easily shareable and reproducible  \n\n---\n\n### How Docker works (simplified)\n\n#### Without Docker (traditional installation)\n| Laptop / PC\n| \u251c\u2500 OS (e.g. Ubuntu 22.04)\n| \u251c\u2500 ROS 2 Humble\n| \u251c\u2500 Python 3.10\n| \u2514\u2500 Manually installed libraries and tools\n\n**Problems:**  \n\u2013 Everyone has a slightly different setup  \n\u2013 Version conflicts are common  \n\u2013 Setup takes time and can break things\n\n#### With Docker\n| Laptop / PC\n| \u251c\u2500 Any OS (Windows, macOS, Linux)\n| \u251c\u2500 Docker Engine\n| \u2514\u2500 Container\n\u251c\u2500 Mini Ubuntu\n\u251c\u2500 ROS 2 Humble\n\u251c\u2500 Python 3.10\n\u2514\u2500 All required tools and libraries\n\n\n**Benefits:**  \n\u2013 Same environment for everyone  \n\u2013 Fast and reliable setup  \n\u2013 Works on all platforms\n\n---\n\n### Container vs. Virtual Machine\n\n> **Containers are not VMs**  \n> Containers share the host OS kernel, making them **lightweight** and **fast** to start, unlike full virtual machines which simulate a complete OS.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nUsing Docker ensures:\n\n- You always have a **working ROS environment**\n- No more setup headaches\n- Easy sharing and portability of projects\n\nEspecially in a robotics summer school with many participants and diverse computers, Docker is the **fastest, safest, and most efficient** way to get everyone up and running.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>What is Docker and why do we use it in robotics?</summary>\n\n  <br/>\n\n  Docker is a containerization platform that lets you package software along with all its dependencies, configurations, and system tools into isolated units called **containers**. Each container behaves like a lightweight virtual computer \u2014 but without the overhead of a full virtual machine.\n\n  In robotics, Docker is especially useful because it allows us to:\n\n  - Avoid the \u201cit works on my machine\u201d problem  \n  - Share **identical environments** across multiple students and developers  \n  - Quickly switch between ROS versions or setups  \n  - Ensure that everyone works with the exact same system configuration\n\n  Without Docker, each student would need to manually install a matching Linux OS, ROS version, simulator setup, and all dependencies \u2014 a tedious and error-prone process.\n\n  Docker containers are cross-platform and portable. You can run them on Windows, macOS, or Linux \u2014 as long as Docker is installed. This makes collaboration, version control, and system replication significantly easier.\n\n  <br/>\n\n  #### Visual overview:\n\n  <img src=\"/EnviroBotics-Docs/img/docker-architecture.png\" alt=\"Docker vs Native Setup Comparison\" style={{ width: '100%', border: '1px solid #ccc', borderRadius: '8px', marginTop: '1rem' }} />\n\n</details>\n\n\n</details>\n"})})]})}function d(n={}){const{wrapper:e}={...(0,a.R)(),...n.components};return e?(0,o.jsx)(e,{...n,children:(0,o.jsx)(u,{...n})}):u(n)}},8453:(n,e,t)=>{t.d(e,{R:()=>i,x:()=>r});var s=t(6540);const o={},a=s.createContext(o);function i(n){const e=s.useContext(a);return s.useMemo(function(){return"function"==typeof n?n(e):{...e,...n}},[e,n])}function r(n){let e;return e=n.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof n.components?n.components(o):n.components||o:i(n.components),s.createElement(a.Provider,{value:e},n.children)}}}]);
