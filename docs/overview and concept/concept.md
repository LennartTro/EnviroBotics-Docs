# Concept of the Summer School

The EnviroBotics Summer School introduces students to environmental robotics, combining hardware, software, and real-world data collection. Participants will work in teams, build their own robots, and program them to perform meaningful tasks related to environmental monitoring.

This documentation serves as your central guide throughout the program.
