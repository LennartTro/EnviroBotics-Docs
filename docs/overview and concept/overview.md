# Welcome to the EnviroBotics Summer School!

Ready to command robots, dive into simulations, and conquer a lake with science?  
Welcome to the **EnviroBotics Summer School**, where we mix code, creativity, and a splash of water.

## 📅 Day 1 – Let’s Get Virtual  
**October 1, 2025, from 1pm to approx. 5pm at Carl-Zeiss-Straße 8 in Garching Hochbrück**

We kick off with an intensive intro session:  
You’ll meet your digital toolbox – **Ubuntu**, **Docker**, **ROS**, and **Gazebo** – and quickly get your hands dirty (well, virtually).

You’ll learn to:

- Send messages with ROS topics  
- Build ROS nodes like a pro  
- Simulate a real robot in a virtual lake

Your mission:  
Use a **PID controller** to make our [BlueBoat](https://bluerobotics.com/store/vehicles/blueboat/) follow GPS targets like a loyal robotic duck. 🦆

> And yes, you can (and should!) continue fine-tuning your controller at home — bonus points for style and stability!

## 🛠 Days 2 & 3 – Build, Hack, Measure  
**October 6–7, 2025, from 10am to approx. 5pm at Carl-Zeiss-Straße 8 in Garching Hochbrück**

Now things get real. You'll split into teams and transform a floating plastic boat into a fully autonomous **environmental researcher**.

Tasks include:

- Mounting a **winch system** to lower a temperature sensor into the lake (yes, we’re going deep 🌊)
- Writing ROS nodes to command it like: “Go to 1.5m, please”
- Logging data (or — for the brave — sending it to shore via wireless comms)

This is hands-on robotics at its best. Sensors, scripts, teamwork, and a few cable ties.

## 🌍 Day 4 – Showtime at the Lake  
**October 10, 2025, from 10am at Carl-Zeiss-Straße 8 in Garching Hochbrück**  
**Location:** *Hollerner Lake*

Time to launch.

Your BlueBoat will:

1. Autonomously navigate to GPS-defined waypoints  
2. Take scientific measurements at each one  
3. Complete the mission — or gracefully sink trying (just kidding... mostly)

Bonus challenge:  
Implement **path planning** to visit all points efficiently. A\* and visibility graphs, or magic — your choice.

---

## 🎓 TL;DR

- Learn to control robots with ROS  
- Build a real-world autonomous sensing platform  
- Deploy it in an actual lake  
- Make friends, learn stuff, get wet (safely)

We can’t wait to see what you’ll build.

Let the (blue) adventure begin! 🚤
