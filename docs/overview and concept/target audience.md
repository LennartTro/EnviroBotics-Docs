# Target Audience

We assume the following

    * you do **not** have experience with Ubuntu or any other Linux distribution

    * you do **not** have experience with terminals/command lines/shells

    * you have rather **little** experience with programming in general

    * you do **not** have experience with programming in Python

If one or more points do **not** apply to you, great! This means, some things will be easier for you. For anyone else: do not feel discouraged if things seem very intimidating at first glance. It is probably quite natural to feel a bit overwhelmed by this whole new world of Linux, the command line and all the rest.

Things will get easier, and start to make more sense, by the time you get used to them. Until then, we hope to provide you with instructions, guides, tutorials, and background knowledge to get you started as smoothly as possible.
