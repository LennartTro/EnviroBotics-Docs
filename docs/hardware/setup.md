      The <strong>BlueBoat</strong> is an autonomous surface vessel developed by <a href="https://bluerobotics.com/store/rov/bluerov2/" target="_blank">BlueRobotics</a>.
      It's designed for environmental monitoring, data collection, and research applications on lakes, rivers, and coastal waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the EnviroBotics Summer School, the BlueBoat serves as a flexible and robust research platform. With GPS-based navigation,
      payload integration support, and compatibility with ROS, it allows students to deploy and test their autonomous algorithms in real-world environments.

      The <strong>Base Station</strong> is a portable control unit that enables remote operation of the BlueBoat during missions. Designed for ease of deployment, the base station connects wirelessly to the BlueBoat via a high-gain radio link. Operators can monitor real-time sensor data, visualize the boat's position and heading, and issue autonomous or manual navigation commands.
